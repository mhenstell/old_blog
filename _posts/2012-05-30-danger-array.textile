title: DangerArray (Incandescent Lighting Array)
---
The DangerArray (or Incandescent Lighting Array) was a quick project I threw together for the NYC Resistor Interactive Show. It consists of seventy two 120 Volt halogen lamps, each individually controllable and dimmable by way of a large array of shift registers and mosfets, controlled from one USB-enabled microcontroller. The Array uses the same C++ and Processing software that we used on the "DomeStar":http://blinkiverse.com/domestar.html.

DJ Friar Tuck does his thing in front of the sound-reactive heat-machine known as the DangerArray.

The DangerArray is still installed at NYC Resistor, although it is no longer powered-up, for good reason.
