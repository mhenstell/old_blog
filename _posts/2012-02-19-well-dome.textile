We built a geodesic dome! I sized out the largest dome we could make using five foot by one inch PVC tubes (a little over eight feet in diameter), and after brunch last Saturday, we walked a rainy mile to Lowes to buy PVC. After trying unsuccessfully to join the PVC using rubber tubing, Adam came up with a great method of flattening the ends and attaching them.

Last night we put on Logan's Run and started dooming. After a brief pause to reheat and bend the ends to the proper angle, the dome went together with great success:
